## Image Processing Algorithm
<hr>
We have to programmatically convert an image of white flowers with an image of purple flowers.

Summary: A picture is made up of pixels. Each pixel has 4 property
ARGB - Alpha, Red, Green, Blue. Value of each of them vary from 0 to 255.


Lets implement the image processing algorithm sequentially first and then in parallel.
