## Vault Case Study
<hr/>
We have a value that has a password, and a couple of hacker threads. These hacker threads tries to bruteforce
the password of the vault. If they are successful to guess the password of the vault within the give time period then, 
they can get away with money inside. If not then they will be caught by the police thread.
